=====

This package provides an interface for commonly-used math and statistical 
functions as 'rollers', and also provides a utility function, 'rollit', 
for generating your own fast, C++ backed rollers.

Install me with devtools:

    install_github("kevinushey/RcppRoll")

and check some examples with

    example(rollit)
